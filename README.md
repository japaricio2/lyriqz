 # Lyriqz
Lyriqz is a web application built because I wanted a better way to find lyrics. It works by using the Spotify and Musixmatch API's. We find out what song you're listening to on Spotify and then go and fetch those lyrics from Musixmatch. 

To use it, just make sure you're playing a song on Spotify. Head over to the website and login through Spotify. Once you've been logged in, the lyrics will automatically display for the currently playing song. If another song starts playing go ahead and hit refresh.
